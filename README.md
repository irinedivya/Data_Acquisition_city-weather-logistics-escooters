# Data_Acquisition_city-weather-logistics-escooters
Using techniques such as webscraping (BeautifulSoup) and API's (Openweather) to create and build a database that moves from python code to being stored in MySQL. The product is a predictive model on where scooters will end up in a city and how to incentivize being located in the more opportune locations.

**Goal:**

Collect data to understand the best opperational locations for e-scooters to be located in each city, and understand thier organic movements
Design predictive model on e-scooter user behavior
Advise an incentive or logistical solution on how to ensure e-scooters are best placed at all times.

**How**

Use webscrapping to obtain basic city information, use API to access weather data to understand habits and rate of basic usage

Use weather information and city geography to design basic predictive model

Use the model to predict on usage and optimal locations.

Coding was done in Jupyter Labs and storage with MySQL APIs Used: OpenWeather, AeroData via rapidapi.com
